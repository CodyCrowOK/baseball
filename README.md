Baseball Statistics Calculator
==============================
A Simple way to calculate player statistics.
--------------------------------------------
I created this PHP/MySQL script for my own team's usage because everything else is both worthless and expensive. This presents a no-nonsense display of statistics for both pitching and hitting.

None of the input is validated, so it would not be wise to place add_batter.php or add_pitcher.php in a public directory. And it would be wise to double check added info.
